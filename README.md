# CS-BME-L3 | Waveform

The following Windows Forms Application displays ascending/descending bars in a histogram-like style. ðŸ“’

Each bar is generated according to a value that can be incremented or decremented based on user interaction.

The result is similar to a sine waveform, of which only the positive values are taken into account. ðŸŒŠ
